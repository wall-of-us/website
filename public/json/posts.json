It’s insightful, funny, and chock full of knowledge, resources, and practical advice on how to build, restore, and supercharge our democracy. <p>What are Kos’ recommendations on how to stay locked in? We’ll give you a preview:</p> <p>“The key is to make activism—and specifically, actions—a part of your lifestyle. Schedule them into your routine as you would shopping, eating, and breathing. Join organizations, like Wall of Us, that feed you a steady diet of new actions to take. Let this become the new normal; do not let your activism become a Trump-induced anomaly. So find a pace that is sustainable but constant. This will be a lifelong fight.”</p> <p>All-of-us need a little Kos in our lives now and then to get us fired up for the battles ahead.
